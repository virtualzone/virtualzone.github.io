Over the weekend I’ve been looking around for a free service which monitors my websites. My requirement was that I want to be able to monitor both HTTP and HTTPS sites, I need support for authentication and the monitoring service should be able to check if a specific keyword exists within the watched site (instead of just assuming that a HTTP Status Code 200 is okay). Furthermore, I needed notifications in case of downtimes (Email and [Pushbullet](https://www.pushbullet.com/) is fine for me).

I discovered [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/). The service fulfils all of my requirements and allows for checks every 5 minutes – for free. Not a bad offer. As far as I can tell, everything works fine and I’m quite happy with it.
