      <description>I’m a convinced user of OneDrive Personal. Bundled with M365, it’s a cheap option to get 1 TB of cloud storage.

Packets to the static IP address are routed to the router as well. Here’s how to set up things up on a Unifi Security Gateway (USG).
By default, USG only allows for one IP address when dialing in via PPPoE.</description>
