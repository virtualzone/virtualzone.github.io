      <description>For more than 2.5 years, Iâ€™ve now been running FHEM with several HomeMatic sensors and actors. Using the HM-CFG-LAN Configuration Tool as an I/O interface between FHEM and the HomeMatic devices, this setup has been running smoothly most of the time. The configuration was a bit tricky now and then, but it worked. However, OpenHAB seems to become a really good choice. Version 2 is currently available as Beta 3. It features a modern web interface and an easy-to-use extension manager.</description>
